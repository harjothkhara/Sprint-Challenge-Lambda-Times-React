- What are PropTypes used for? Please describe why it's important to type check our data in JavaScript.

PropTypes are used to catch any errors in our code by making sure the data that were passing around is of the correct type. For example, if we wanted to type check certain object properties in our array to make sure they were of the right type(string, numbersâ€¦), PropTypes would allow us to check and provide a warning message if the data type we were passing down was incorrect.
